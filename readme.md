## Steps to initiate app

If you do not have dependecies/requirements installed:
1. Install pip in your venv
2. Open terminal/bash in root directory
3. Enter 'pip install -r requirements.txt'

After the dependencies and requirements have been installed:
1. Ensure the smart-money-concepts_old folder is unzipped and unpacked into the directory
2. Open a terminal/bash window in project root directory
3. Run the app by entering 'python app.py'
    a. for running the dashboard visualization, run command 'python app_test.py' instead

The app should now open a browser window and start running
